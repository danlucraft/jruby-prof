This is a clone of ruby-prof for JRuby. It supports all the usual output
modes, plus a call tree output mode. 

The only measure mode it currently supports is wall time.

*** NB. This is really new code. It probably has lots of bugs and things. - March 2010 ***

INSTALL
-------

    $ jruby -S gem install jruby-prof
    
USAGE
-----

In your program:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'jruby-prof'
    
    result = JRubyProf.profile do
      # my stuff
    end
    
    JRubyProf.print_flat_text(result, "flat.txt")
    JRubyProf.print_graph_text(result, "graph.txt")
    JRubyProf.print_graph_html(result, "graph.html")
    JRubyProf.print_call_tree(result, "call_tree.txt")
    JRubyProf.print_tree_html(result, "call_tree.html")

In order to tell JRuby to send events to JRubyProf for processing, you must
run your script with the debug flag on:

    $ jruby --debug my_script.rb


Or you can use its gem script:

    $ jruby --debug -S jruby-prof scriptname.rb
    
Which will profile the entire script, create a local directory named "profile" and output one copy of each graph type there.
